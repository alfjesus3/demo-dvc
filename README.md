# demo-dvc
To explore Data Version Control in ML projects


## DVC Installation
* To introduce DVC in a existing Github project install DVC with ````conda install -n YOUR_ENVIRONMENT_NAME -c conda-forge dvc``` or with ```pip install dvc```;

### Notes
* Data Version Control (DVC) allows to store specific (data, code, model) "tuples" just like Git. For that it uses metafiles - https://dvc.org/doc/user-guide/project-structure
